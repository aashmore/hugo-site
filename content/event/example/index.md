abstract: Calabi-Yau manifolds have played a key role in both mathematics and
  physics, and are particularly important for deriving realistic models of
  particle physics from string theory. Without the explicit metrics on these
  spaces, we have resorted to numerical methods, and now have a variety of
  techniques to find approximate metrics. I will present recent work on what one
  can do with these numerical metrics, focusing on the 'data' of the spectrum of
  the Laplacian. Computing this for many different points in complex structure
  moduli space, we will see that the spectrum displays random matrix statistics,
  suggesting that certain 2d SCFTs are chaotic.
