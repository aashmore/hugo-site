I’m a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical physics. My work focuses on the geometry of string compactifications. At the moment, I’m a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow at the University of Chicago, heading to Sorbonne Université in 2023.

You’ll find more about me at the links above and a few posts on physics, mathematics, Mathematica, and maybe even cooking.

I grew up in the seaside town of Blackpool in the UK and did my undergraduate degree at the University of Oxford. After that, I completed a PhD at Imperial College London before taking up a Junior Research Fellowship at Merton College, University of Oxford. I then moved to the University of Pennsylvania before heading to Chicago.

My work is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 838776.
