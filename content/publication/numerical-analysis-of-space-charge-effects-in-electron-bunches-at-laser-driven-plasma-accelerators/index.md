abstract: Laser-driven Plasma Accelerators (LPA) have successfully generated
  high energy, high charge electron bunches which can reach many kA peak
  current, over short distances. Space charge issues, even in transport lines as
  simple as a drift section, have to be carefully taken into account since they
  can degrade the beam quality, preventing any further application of such
  electron beams. We analyse the space charge effects within an electron bunch
  with numerical simulations in order to assess their effect on the beam. We use
  LPA beam parameters published in previous experimental studies. These studies
  can give an indication of the working point where space charge can dominate
  the beam dynamics and has to be taken into account in the application of such
  beams.
